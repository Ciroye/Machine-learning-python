# Machine learning resources  
This is a repository where several resources will found for the realization of machine learning models with python, from data loading, to neural network models. Passing through several of the best known models of supervised learning (linear regression, logistics) and unsupervised learning (KNN, clustering, etc); looking to be a toolbox of queries when creating models. The majority of resources are based on the Machine Learning course of Professor Juan Gabriel Gomilla (A genius).
